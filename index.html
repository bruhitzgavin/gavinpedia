    <p> Is there somebody in your class you want to become friends with but you don't know how to go about it? Don't worry, it's very simple. At a free time, go up to them and introduce yourself, make sure not to be nervous! If that's not your cup of tea, if you ever get the chance to request someone to work in a group with you, request them, which will give you time to talk to them about work, and get to know them. Your conversations start from there.</p>
